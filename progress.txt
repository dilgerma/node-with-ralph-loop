Step 6: Generated code-slice.json with test specifications

## $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') - Add Book Slice - COMPLETE

**What was implemented:**
- Created basic project structure (src/, package.json, tsconfig.json, jest.config.js)
- Implemented Add Book STATE_CHANGE slice with CommandHandler
- Created BookAdded event type
- Implemented test with full field validation
- Generated code-slice.json for drift detection

**Files changed:**
- package.json (created)
- tsconfig.json (created)
- jest.config.js (created)
- src/events/index.ts (created)
- src/events/ContextEvents.ts (created)
- src/slices/addbook/CommandHandler.ts (created)
- src/slices/addbook/AddBook.test.ts (created)
- .slices/Library/addbook/code-slice.json (created)
- .slices/index.json (updated status to Done)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Project started from scratch without existing src directory
- Used simplified test approach with direct decide() call instead of DeciderSpecification API
- code-slice.json generated because slice.json had empty specifications array
- All tests pass, build passes
